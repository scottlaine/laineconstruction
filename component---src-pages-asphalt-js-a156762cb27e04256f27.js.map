With the continuous loss of this ‘glue’, the aggregates in the top layer begins to ravel and will show surface cracks. If these cracks are not properly filled, and the pavement is not sealed in time the water will penetrate the sub-base causing more cracks, ruts, potholes and eventual failure of the blacktop.</p>\n                    <p>Just like a high quality paint job, prepping the blacktop is crucial — edging, cleaning and repairing all damage first before applying the protective layer or ‘shield’ of sealer is critical to ensuring a longer lasting and aesthetically pleasing blacktop.</p>\n                    <p>Our goal is to beautify and extend the life of the asphalt. Paving is not only expensive but uses a lot of our natural resources – another reason it is important to sustain your blacktop investment.</p>\n                    <a href=\"/get-a-quote\" className=\"button next scrolly\">GET A QUOTE</a>\n                </div>\n            </section>\n        </div>\n    </Layout>\n)\n\nexport default Generic","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/asphalt2-cd0b32afb5aa9ce81f206bfd4caded4a.jpg\";"],"sourceRoot":""}
