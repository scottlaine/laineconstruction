A sealer will improve your driveway’s appearance, keep UV rays from causing it to fade and protect it from stains."),r.a.createElement("p",null,"Whether your driveway is stamped or exposed concrete, sealing after the concrete has cured, and every few years after, is recommended as part of the maintenance routine. A sealed concrete driveway will have a rich color and glossy sheen if desired. Sealers are available in many different gloss levels, ranging from no-gloss to high-gloss. Additionally, you can apply a slip resistant sealer if you driveway is sloped (note: slip resistance is extremely beneficial on pool decks, stairs and sidewalks, wherever you may walk when it is wet)."),r.a.createElement("p",null,"Stain protection is another benefit of sealing a concrete driveway.
